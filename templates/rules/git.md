# Git Rules

## Commit Messages

### Format

```
<type>: <description>
```

With body (optional):

```
<type>: <description>

<body>
```

### Types

| Type | When |
|------|------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code change (no new feature, no fix) |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding/fixing tests |
| `chore` | Build, config, dependencies |

### Rules

- Max 50 chars in title
- Imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Lowercase: don't capitalize first letter
- No period at the end
- No AI attribution (no "Co-Authored-By", "Generated by", etc.)

### Examples

```bash
# Good
feat: add leaderboard sorting
fix: handle null pnl in stats calculation
refactor: extract exchange client factory
test: add trader profile api tests
chore: update dependencies

# Bad
feat: Add leaderboard sorting.          # Uppercase, period
Added sorting to leaderboard            # No type, past tense
feat: add sorting feature to leaderboard for users to sort by pnl  # Too long
```

## Branches

### Naming

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

Examples:
- `feat/leaderboard-sorting`
- `fix/null-pnl-crash`
- `refactor/exchange-client`

### Rules

- No direct commits to `main`
- Feature branches from `main`
- Delete branch after merge

## Workflow

1. Create branch: `git checkout -b feat/thing`
2. Make changes, commit often
3. Push: `git push -u origin feat/thing`
4. PR or merge when ready
5. Delete branch after merge

## .gitignore

Always ignore:
- `.env` / `.env.local`
- `node_modules/`
- `.next/`
- `dist/`
- IDE files (`.idea/`, `.vscode/`)
